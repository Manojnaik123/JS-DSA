/**

Number 5: Top K Elements Algorithm 
    - Used to find the top K largest or most frequent elements in an array.

Number 4: Sliding Window Algorithm 
    - Used to solve problems like finding the longest substring without repeating characters or the maximum sum subarray with a specific length.

Number 3: Backtracking 
    - Used for problems like combination sum and word ladder.

Number 2: Dynamic Programming (DP) 
    - Useful for solving problems like the longest increasing subsequence and the longest common subsequence.

Number 1: Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) 
    - Both of these algorithms are used for traversing graphs.
